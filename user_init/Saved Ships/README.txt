READ THIS FIRST BEFORE HANDLING SHIP SAVE FILES

Cosmoteer Ship designs are saved, literally, as PNG image files of the ships. The data necessary to load and play with the ship design is stored in the PNG pixel data itself.

Because of this, do not in any way alter the saved PNG file! Do not resize it or alter its pixels! Doing so will almost certainly corrupt the file and Cosmoteer will be unable to load the ship design from the file.

Similarly, many image-hosting websites will down-scale or decrease the quality of images. Using such websites will also corrupt the file.
